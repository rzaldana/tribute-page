			<h2 id="intro">Here's a timeline of Bjork's early life and career:</h2>
					<section id="early-life">
						<h3>Early Life:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Bjork was born on 21 November 1965 in Reykjavik, Iceland to Hildur Runa Hauksdottir and Guomundur Gunnarsson. Her father was a union leader and her mother was an activist who protested against a hydro-electric development in Iceland. </li>

							<li>Her parents knew each other since they were 14 but their marriage fell apart when Bjork was born as her mother did not want to be a house-wife. She left with Bjork and became a part of a hippie group. </li>
							<li>Her mother got married to a guitarist in Iceland, for the second time. He was considered at the time the ‘Jimi Hendrix’ of Iceland. This gave Bjork a musical environment to grow up and to learn music at a very young age.</li>
							<li>She was only 11 years old when she first started studying classical music with piano in her elementary school. One of her recordings was sent to RUV, a radio station in Iceland. It was broadcasted on the radio.</li>
							<li>In 1977, when she was only 12 years old, her first album ‘Bjork’ came out and she signed a contract with the Falkinn record label. It happened after a representative from the label heard her recording on the radio.</li>
							<li>By the time she was 14 years old, Bjork collaborated an all-girl punk band called ‘Spit and Snot’ and formed a jazz fusion group called ‘Exodus’ in 1979.</li>
